Sure! Let's debug the code step by step:

Step 1: Initialization
- The array `nums` is defined and initialized with values `{0, 4, 1, 5, 3, 0}`.
- The `Arrays.sort(nums)` function is called to sort the array in ascending order.
- The `arr` array is defined and initialized with the same length as `nums`.
- Two variables `temp` and `max` are declared and initialized to 0 and `nums.length - 1` respectively.
- The first `for` loop starts iterating from `i = 0` to `max`.

Step 2: First Iteration
- At `i = 0`, the condition `nums[i] != 0` is false since `nums[0]` equals 0.
- Hence, the code enters the `else` block and assigns `0` to `arr[max]`. Thus, `arr[max]` equals `0`.
- `max` is then decremented by 1, so `max` becomes `max - 1 = 4`.
- The values of `temp` and `max` are printed. (`temp: 0`, `max: 4`)

Step 3: Second Iteration
- At `i = 1`, `nums[i]` is `1`. Since it is not equal to `0`, the code enters the `if` block.
- `arr[temp]` is assigned the value `1`, so `arr[temp]` becomes `1`.
- `temp` is incremented by 1, so `temp` becomes `temp + 1 = 1`.
- The values of `temp` and `max` are printed. (`temp: 1`, `max: 4`)

Step 4: Third Iteration
- At `i = 2`, `nums[i]` is `3`. Again, it is not equal to `0`, so the code enters the `if` block.
- `arr[temp]` is assigned the value `3`, so `arr[temp]` becomes `3`.
- `temp` is incremented by 1, so `temp` becomes `temp + 1 = 2`.
- The values of `temp` and `max` are printed. (`temp: 2`, `max: 4`)

Step 5: Fourth Iteration
- At `i = 3`, `nums[i]` is `4`. It is not equal to `0`, so the code enters the `if` block.
- `arr[temp]` is assigned the value `4`, so `arr[temp]` becomes `4`.
- `temp` is incremented by 1, so `temp` becomes `temp + 1 = 3`.
- The values of `temp` and `max` are printed. (`temp: 3`, `max: 4`)

Step 6: Fifth Iteration
- At `i = 4`, `nums[i]` is `5`, which is not equal to `0`.
- `arr[temp]` is assigned the value `5`, so `arr[temp]` becomes `5`.
- `temp` is incremented by 1, so `temp` becomes `temp + 1 = 4`.
- The values of `temp` and `max` are printed. (`temp: 4`, `max: 4`)

Step 7: Sixth Iteration
- At `i = 5`, `nums[i]` is `0`. Since it is equal to `0`, the code enters the `else` block.
- `arr[max]` is assigned the value `0`, so `arr[max]` becomes `0`.
- `max` is decremented by 1, so `max` becomes `4 - 1 = 3`.
- The values of `temp` and `max` are printed. (`temp: 4`, `max: 3`)

Step 8: Loop ends
- The first loop ends, and the program continues to the next loop.

Step 9: Printing the `arr` array
- The second `for` loop starts, iterating from `i = 0` to `arr.length - 1`.
- The values of `arr` are printed: `1 3 4 5 0 0`.

Therefore, the final output of the program is `1 3 4 5 0 0`, which moves all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the original order of the non-zero elements.
